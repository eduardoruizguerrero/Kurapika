# Kurapika  
Guess Kurapika's number!.  
## Editing code!.  
If you change let **maxnumber** to look like **minnumber**, the _p_ html element changes its text.  
These variables are the limit number generated.  
If your **attempts end**, the input is **disabled**, for each given condition the image **is changed**, etc.
